# Application Foundation

## An extremely rapid build that gives your startup a clean, trustworthy codebase: everything you need to unleash your real product.

---

You’ve talked to a dozen developers.

Every quote sounds different, but every promise sounds the same, and none of it feels right in your gut.

Deep down, you know that most apps share the same foundation: login screens, password resets, file uploads, admin dashboards, and that the magic is in what you add *on top of that*.

So why does it feel like everyone’s rebuilding the same thing from scratch, and charging you for it?

At **Portico Foundry**, we built that foundation once: clean, secure, and ready to extend.

In five days, we hand you a well-architected codebase that’s truly yours: something you own, and your own developers can build on confidently, without reinventing the plumbing.

You stay focused on your product and your vision. We make sure the technology is never the thing holding you back.

**Our Highest Intentions**

At **Portico Foundry**, our work isn’t just about code. It’s about helping first-time founders move from uncertainty to confidence — from wondering who to trust, to knowing exactly what they own and how to move forward.

We built this because too many great ideas never make it past the planning stage. The tech feels opaque. The process feels expensive. And the whole thing starts to feel out of reach.

Our goal is to bring clarity, integrity, and momentum back to early-stage software creation.  
 Here’s what that means for us:

| Empower founders to build confidently. We want you to feel grounded and in control — to understand your foundation and trust that it’s solid. | Demystify the tech. You shouldn’t need to become an engineer to know what you’re buying. We make architecture transparent, simple, and human. | Eliminate waste. Most apps share 80% of the same foundation. You shouldn’t have to pay to rebuild that from scratch. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Protect independence.** You own what you build — permanently. No lock-ins, no fine print, no dependencies you can’t escape. | **Accelerate creation.** We make it possible to move from concept to code quickly, without compromising quality or ownership. |  |

These intentions are our compass.

They remind us that our real product isn’t just a codebase — it’s *your confidence* in bringing your vision to life.

**Portico Foundry** is for founders who see an opportunity and refuse to let technology stand in their way.

You don’t need to be an engineer; you just need a clear idea and the desire to bring it to life.

| Who it’s for: It’s for the entrepreneur who’s received too many quotes that didn’t make sense. The one who knows their idea is sound but isn’t sure who to trust. The one who’s realized that most apps are built on the same building blocks anyway — login, accounts, uploads, notifications — and wonders why it has to feel so hard. | Who it’s not for:  We’re not the right fit if you’re looking for a fully finished, turnkey app — or a dev agency to manage it long-term. We don’t take over your product; we help you start it right. And if you’re still exploring an idea without a clear direction or plan, our process will probably feel premature. |

If that sounds like you on the left, you’re in the right place.

We built Portico Foundry to give you a foundation you can understand, own, and grow from.

#### **Our Approach: Foundations First**

Most agencies start with features.

We start with *foundations* because a product is only as strong as the structure beneath it.

At Portico Foundry, we believe the fastest way to build something meaningful is to begin with clarity, not code. That’s why our process doesn’t look like traditional development.

1. **We build what’s universal once.**  
   Every modern app shares 80% of the same building blocks. We’ve engineered those once to be clean, secure, and production-ready, so your time and money go toward what makes your product unique.

2. **We design for ownership.**  
   You own every line. There’s no hidden dependency, no platform lock-in, no mystery architecture. Your developers can read, extend, and scale the foundation as if they wrote it themselves.

3. **We move fast because we’ve prepared deeply.**  
   The five-day sprint isn’t a gimmick — it’s the product of hundreds of hours of pre-built, audited code and refined process. You don’t get speed *instead* of quality; you get speed *through* quality.

4. **We teach as we build.**  
   Every engagement includes a live walkthrough and documentation that demystifies the tech. You leave not just with a codebase, but with the confidence to steer it.

5. **We believe independence is the ultimate deliverable.**  
    Our success is when you no longer need us — when your team can take the reins and grow your vision freely.

#### **What Will Be Covered**

Our work begins where your idea becomes a plan.  
 If you already know what you want to build — your users, your features, your goals — we help you start it right.  
 In five focused days, we create the technical foundation that turns your product plan into a living, buildable reality.

---

**Day 1 — Foundation Briefing**  
 We start with your existing product plan: reviewing core user flows, priorities, and intended architecture.  
 Together, we identify the foundational components every app needs — authentication, file handling, data layer, admin tools — and outline how your unique features will plug in later.

**Day 2 — Architecture Setup**  
 We establish your development environment and configure the Portico Application Framework — our reusable, security-audited foundation.  
 This includes accounts, file management, and key service integrations — everything your team needs to start building with confidence.

**Day 3 — Extension Points & Scaffolding**  
 We prepare clean, well-documented spaces in your code where your developers can safely add product-specific logic and features.  
 This means well-defined boundaries, example patterns, and extensibility built in from the start — no fragile “custom code” to unravel later.

**Day 4 — Validation & Review**  
 We test the system end-to-end, review performance, and ensure every component aligns with best practices for security and maintainability.  
 You’ll explore your working foundation live and understand exactly how to extend it.

**Day 5 — Handoff & Empowerment**  
 We document everything and conduct a full walkthrough with your team — explaining the architecture, build pipeline, and recommended next steps.  
 You leave with a production-ready foundation **and** the confidence to grow your product independently.

#### **What You’ll Walk Away With**

* A complete, production-grade application foundation — the same infrastructure most products spend months reinventing.

* Cleanly defined extension points for your own features.

* Documentation and architecture maps your developers can trust.

* Transparent, dependency-free ownership of your codebase.

* A clear roadmap for how to build from here.

### **How We Deliver the Work**

#### **1\. Product Architecture Blueprint Session (Live Call)**

A 90-minute strategy session where we review your product plan, clarify technical and architectural needs, and identify the boundaries of what will be built by your team versus what will be scaffolded by us.  
 **Why it’s included:** This sets the direction for the work — it aligns the technical, product, and human perspectives before any code is written.  
 **The experience:** Expect a collaborative whiteboard conversation, with your leads engaged in mapping out the structure of the system.

#### **2\. Custom Architecture Specification (Document \+ Review)**

A written artifact describing the recommended architecture: key components, integration points, and “insertion zones” where your team will later implement product-specific modules.  
 **Why it’s included:** It turns discussion into a clear and referenceable map.  
 **The experience:** You’ll receive a structured, well-annotated doc ready for engineering review, followed by a walkthrough to confirm understanding.

#### **3\. Foundational Framework Setup (Codebase Delivery)**

We create and deliver the foundational parts of your system: the shared scaffolding, environment setup, and extension points that your developers can build upon.  
 **Why it’s included:** This ensures that your internal team starts from a clean, well-documented base that supports long-term maintainability and modularity.  
 **The experience:** A ready-to-run codebase and clear instructions for setup, reviewed together in a brief handoff call.

#### **4\. Integration Support (Slack \+ Optional Office Hours)**

As your team integrates and extends the system, we remain available for async guidance via Slack and/or optional weekly office hours.  
 **Why it’s included:** To maintain flow and confidence through the implementation phase.  
 **The experience:** Quick, practical answers and design-level feedback to keep your developers unblocked.

### **Pricing**

**$25,000**  
 

*Payment can be made in full or split into two installments.*

We also offer **Heart-Centered Pricing** — an approach rooted in mutual respect and openness. If you feel deeply aligned with this work but the price presents a barrier, we invite a conversation to explore whether a structure can be found that honors both your circumstances and the integrity of the work.

## **Cancellation & Refund Policy**

At Portico Foundry, our work begins well before we ever write a line of code.  
 Each engagement is carefully scheduled, with significant preparation, coordination, and custom setup done in advance of your build week. Because of that, we hold space for your project and turn away other work once your engagement is confirmed.

That said, we understand that life and startups can change direction. Our goal is always to handle those moments with clarity, fairness, and respect for everyone involved.

### **If you need to reschedule**

If you need to shift your build week, we’ll do our best to accommodate.

* **At least 21 days’ notice:** We’ll happily reschedule you for another available slot at no cost.

* **Less than 21 days’ notice:** We may charge a **10% rescheduling fee** to cover lost preparation time and calendar disruption.

### **If you need to cancel**

* **More than 30 days before your scheduled start:**  
   Your deposit (50%) will be refunded, minus a **$500 planning and administrative fee**.

* **15–30 days before start:**  
   50% of your total fee is refundable.

* **Within 14 days of your start date:**  
   The full project fee is considered committed and non-refundable, as the team and preparation are already in motion.

### **Heart-Centered Consideration**

If unexpected hardship arises (personal or business), please reach out. We’re open to honest conversation and will do our best to find a fair solution — whether that’s postponement, partial credit toward a future engagement, or another arrangement that honors both our time and integrity.

Our aim is simple: to treat each other as partners building something meaningful together — with clear agreements that protect the focus and trust we both bring to the work.
